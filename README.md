## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- Iâ€™m currently working with backend development for banking services. 
- Main technologies that I work with:
  - Kotlin
  - Spring
  - PostgreSQL
  - Messaging and queues services like SQS and Kafka
  - Monitoring tools, like Grafana for dashboards and Splunk for logging
- I like to read and study about microsservices and Rest APIs, DDD, design patterns, clean architecture, best practices for clean code etc.
- IT degree.
